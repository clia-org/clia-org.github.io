This is the moment the two trajectories converge.

- **OpenClaw** brings real-world execution: channels, ops, automations.
- **CLIA** brings governed autonomy: Triads, S-Type, isolation, memory.

When Claw meets CLIA, the system becomes:
- **operational** (it can do real work),
- **legible** (it can explain itself),
- and **scalable** (it can grow a roster without turning into a swarm).
