The two projects took different routes:

- **OpenClaw** climbed quickly: visible capability increased early.
- **CLIA** moved laterally first: it tackled the hard foundation (governance, safety, isolation), then rose to meet the same capability.

They converge at the same point — **Feb 1** — where the system becomes both **operational** *and* **legible**.

## 2026 update: legibility became a roster

Since that convergence, the big change has been *presentation*: CLIA stopped being “a pile of roles” and started being a **personified roster**.

Instead of channels and docs organized around generic titles (e.g. “product-manager”), the system is now organized around **named personas** (with consistent voice, scope, and responsibilities) and a clear **org home** where applicable.

This matters because legibility isn’t just architecture — it’s whether humans can quickly answer:
- *who* is responsible,
- *where* they operate (org/workspace), and
- *what* they’re best at.

## Codex: the bridge year

Mid‑2025, CLIA was still solving the hard foundation problem — it looked like it was “going straight through the floor.”
That work paid off when CLIA was **elevated to reach Codex**.

Codex then held the line (steady capability) until OpenClaw arrived.
Today, Codex is still at roughly that same level — a stable platform point — while CLIA and OpenClaw meet at the Feb 1 convergence.

## Why this matters

Fast vertical progress is great for shipping. Slow horizontal progress is what makes autonomy safe.

- OpenClaw optimizes for **running agents in the real world** (messaging, automations, operational glue).
- CLIA optimizes for **governed autonomy** (Triads + S‑Type, isolation posture, auditability, and durable memory).

The 2026 roster shift is the “third axis”: **legible identity**. Without it, you can have good tooling and good governance and still end up with a confusing swarm of near-duplicate roles.
