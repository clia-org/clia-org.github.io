# Brand Identity

CLIA Org’s website should read like a **living operating manual** for an autonomous GitHub organization.

This page is the canonical reference for **look, tone, structure, and information hierarchy**.

## Positioning

CLIA is a local-first, agentic operating system for software teams — designed to run as an **autonomous GitHub organization**.

- The website should feel like: **docs-first product**, not a marketing splash.
- The promise is: **legible autonomy** (governed, auditable, safe by default).

## Information hierarchy (front page)

Order matters:

1) **Autonomous GitHub org** (what it is, why it matters)
2) **Architecture** (how it works: Triads + S‑Type)
3) **Wrapped / narrative artifacts** (2025 Wrapped and future yearly stories)

## Visual style

- **Crisp, minimal, systems-y.**
- Use whitespace and headings; avoid dense walls of text.
- Prefer short sections that can be linked directly.

### Color

- Default to a calm **blue** system identity (DocC `@PageColor(blue)` is fine).
- No loud gradients unless used sparingly for “Wrapped” art.

### Imagery

- Use illustrations/icons that read as **tooling + systems**, not “AI faces”.
- “Wrapped” assets can be more playful, but should not dominate the main identity.

## Voice & tone

- Confident, technical, grounded.
- Avoid hype (“revolutionary”, “magic”).
- Prefer verbs and concrete claims: *governed*, *auditable*, *local-first*, *reversible*, *type-safe*.

## Content patterns

### Pages should answer

- What is this?
- How do I use it?
- How does it stay safe?
- Where is the source of truth?

### Link style

- Prefer DocC links (`<doc:...>`) inside the site.
- Use external links sparingly; when used, keep them purposeful (ecosystem foundations, canonical repos).

## Navigation rules

- Architecture topics (Triads, S‑Type, timeline) should be reachable within **one click** from the root.
- “Wrapped” should be clearly marked as **story/artifact**, not the definition of CLIA.
