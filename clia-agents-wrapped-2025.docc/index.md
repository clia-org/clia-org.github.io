# CLIA Org

A local-first, agentic operating system for software teams — designed to run as an **autonomous GitHub organization**.

CLIA is the command line where:

- issues become incidents
- repos become workspaces
- and automation becomes a governed system (not a black box)

CLIA is also a **secure process execution engine** with **complete memory isolation** — so secrets never leak to tools.

Built on the broader ecosystem: [Swift Universal](https://swift-universal.github.io/documentation/swift-universal).

## 2025 Wrapped

The story of the year — the people, the tools, and the moments.

## The Vibe Check

2025 wasn't just about writing code; it was about **defining the soul of the machine**. You moved from "scripts" to **Typed CLIs**, from "folders" to **Triads**, and from "running tasks" to **Orchestrating Agents**.

> "Advance rapidly, but only in deliberate, incremental strides." — *The Meta³ Mantra*

### Your Top Genre: "Typed Infrastructure"

You spent 80% of your time in the **Infrastructure** genre. You didn't just build apps; you built the *factory* that builds the apps.

- **Top Hit:** `clia core triads normalize` (played 4,000 times*)
- **Breakout Single:** `CommonShell` (feat. No More Foundation.Process)
- **Mood:** Deterministic & Type-Safe.

> *Estimated based on how much we talk about normalization.*

## Your Year in Stats

| Metric | Score | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Directives Issued** | **$sync** | You really like reloading context. |
| **Schemas Upgraded** | **0.3 → 0.4** | The "Triad" era begins. |
| **Files Moved** | **∞** | The Great `.clia/` Migration of October. |
| **Incidents** | **Managed** | Patch closed loops faster than you opened them. |

### The "Oh No" Moment
*Remember when we renamed `SwiftShell` to `CommonShell` and broke the build for 3 days?*
We laughed. We cried. We added a `no-op` wrapper. Good times.

## The Eras

@Row {
    @Column {
        ### Q1–Q2: The "Mono" Era
        We lived in `code/mono`. We built `Trader`. We validated the "One Repo to Rule Them All" hypothesis.
    }
    
    @Column {
        ### Q3: The "Agent" Era
        `.clia/agents/` was born. We stopped writing TODOs and started writing **Mandates**. `Codex` woke up.
    }
    
    @Column {
        ### Q4: The "Triad" Era
        Schema 0.4.0. Agent, Agency, Agenda. JSON became our love language.
    }
}
