The two projects took different routes:

- **OpenClaw** climbed quickly: visible capability increased early.
- **CLIA** moved laterally first: it tackled the hard foundation (governance, safety, isolation), then rose to meet the same capability.

They converge at the same point — **Feb 1** — where the system becomes both **operational** *and* **legible**.

## Codex: the bridge year

Mid‑2025, CLIA was still solving the hard foundation problem — it looked like it was “going straight through the floor.”
That work paid off when CLIA was **elevated to reach Codex**.

Codex then held the line (steady capability) until OpenClaw arrived.
Today, Codex is still at roughly that same level — a stable platform point — while CLIA and OpenClaw meet at the Feb 1 convergence.

## Why this matters

Fast vertical progress is great for shipping. Slow horizontal progress is what makes autonomy safe.

- OpenClaw optimizes for **running agents in the real world**.
- CLIA optimizes for **governed autonomy**: structures like Triads + S‑Type, and a secure execution posture where secrets don’t leak to tools.
