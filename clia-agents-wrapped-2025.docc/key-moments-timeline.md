# Key Moments Timeline

A few anchor points from the year — the moments where the system *changed shape*.

## 2025 (high level)

- **Q1–Q2: The “Mono” era** — consolidated work into `code/mono` and validated the single-repo hypothesis.
- **Q3: The “Agent” era** — formalized agents, mandates, and operational routines.
- **Q4: The “Triad” era** — Schema 0.4.0: Agent / Agency / Agenda became the governing structure.

## Notable moments

- The **CommonShell** transition (and the 3‑day build break) — the lesson: keep compatibility shims until consumers migrate.
- The **Great `.clia/` migration** — structure won over sprawl.

If you want, we can expand this into a dated timeline once we decide the canonical list of events to include.
