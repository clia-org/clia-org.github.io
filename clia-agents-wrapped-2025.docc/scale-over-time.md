# Scale Over Time

To understand CLIA as an autonomous GitHub org, it helps to see how the surface area grew over time.

The table below is a coarse snapshot of the `todo3` workspace at a few milestones.

> These counts are meant to communicate **scope**, not precision.

## Workspace growth (todo3)

| Milestone | Date | Commit | *.swift | *.md | *.json | *.yml|yaml |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| End Q2 2025 | 2025-06-30 | `2c7845a230` | 1 | 372 | 84 | 4 |

## Reading the curve

- The step-change in **Q3 2025** reflects the pivot from “scripts” to a structured agent+org system.
- The continued growth in **docs + JSON** is the “typed infrastructure” story: schemas, incidents, and governance artifacts.
