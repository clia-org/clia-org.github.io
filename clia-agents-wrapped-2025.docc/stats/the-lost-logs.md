## The Cutting Room Floor

Every breakthrough is built on a mountain of failed experiments. In 2025, we deleted more than we kept.

### Reverted Approaches
- **YAML Front Matter:** Briefly attempted in October. Swift's `Codable` and our collective sanity demanded JSON.
- **WrkstrmShell:** The predecessor to `CommonShell`. It served us well, but its time had passed.
- **The "No Symlink" Policy:** We tried to keep everything flat. Then we realized how useful `ln -s` really is.

### Lessons Learned
- **Error 1:** Trying to use `Foundation.Process` in a typed repo.
- **Error 2:** Forgetting to `$sync` after updating a triad.
- **Error 3:** Underestimating the power of a good Figlet banner.
