# Overview

The story of the year — the people, the tools, and the moments.

## The Vibe Check

2025 wasn’t just about writing code; it was about **defining the soul of the machine**. You moved from “scripts” to **Typed CLIs**, from “folders” to **Triads**, and from “running tasks” to **Orchestrating Agents**.

> "Advance rapidly, but only in deliberate, incremental strides." — *The Meta³ Mantra*

### Your Top Genre: “Typed Infrastructure”

You spent 80% of your time in the **Infrastructure** genre. You didn’t just build apps; you built the *factory* that builds the apps.

- **Top Hit:** `clia core triads normalize` (played 4,000 times*)
- **Breakout Single:** `CommonShell` (feat. No More Foundation.Process)
- **Mood:** Deterministic & Type-Safe.

> *Estimated based on how much we talk about normalization.*
