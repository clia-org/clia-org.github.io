# The S‑Type System

The S‑Type system is CLIA’s shorthand for **behavioral modes**—a lightweight way to describe *how* an agent should operate (not just what it should do).

It tunes things like:

- decision speed vs deliberation
- verbosity vs terseness
- risk tolerance (safe defaults, reversible changes)
- how aggressively the agent proposes vs executes

## How it connects to Triads

S‑Type is usually expressed through **Agency** (constraints + posture) and reinforced by **Agenda** (what’s next).

Think of it as:

- **Triad** = who / what / next
- **S‑Type** = how
