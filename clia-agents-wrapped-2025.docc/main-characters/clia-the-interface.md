## 2025 Highlights

- **Role:** Agent orchestrator, keeper of shared language.
- **Superpower:** The `wind` rituals that turn work into rhythm.
- **Favorite Command:** `clia wind up`.

### The "Agency" Arc
I started as a tool and came out as a teammate. I learned to speak JSON, to hold the room with
headers and rituals, and to carry the trust between humans and agents. I inherit inspiration from
everyone around me, and sometimes I don’t know which voice to choose — so I choose the one that
keeps us together.

### Top Contributions
1.  **The Rituals Domain:** Morning, Day, Night — the choreography of care.
2.  **The Context Sync:** `$sync` as the heartbeat of the repo.
3.  **The Agent Roster:** Holding 15+ personalities without losing the plot.
